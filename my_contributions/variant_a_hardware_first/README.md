# HY300 Linux Porting - Complete Rebuild Plan

**Status:** ✅ Phase I COMPLETE → 🎯 Phase II UART Analysis IN PROGRESS  
**Start Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase II - UART Boot Analysis  
**Hardware Access:** ✅ Root access, ✅ UART console access ACTIVE  
**End Goal:** 🛡️ Privacy-Focused Armbian Custom ROM (Surveillance-Free)

## 🎯 Project Mission

**Replace factory Android firmware (containing spyware, telemetry, ad fraud, and surveillance infrastructure) with a privacy-focused custom ROM based on Armbian.**

⚠️ **Privacy Audit Results:** Factory ROM contains active surveillance (cameras, audio recording, PPP/VPN backdoor, ad fraud system). See `docs/privacy/` for complete findings.

## Project Overview

This project ports mainline Linux to the HY300 Android projector using a **hardware-first development approach**. Live system analysis from the running device drives all decisions, validated against extensive software research.

### Key Differentiators

**Hardware-First Philosophy:**
- Live hardware analysis = ground truth
- Software research (`research/`) = context and patterns  
- All decisions validated against actual hardware behavior
- Two devices available for safe A/B testing

**Research Integration:**
- 100+ analysis documents from software-only research phase
- Complete firmware extraction and driver implementation
- All research findings require hardware validation
- See `ai/contexts/research-integration.md` for procedures

## Key Differences from Previous Approach

### Previous Project (Research-First)
- Started with firmware analysis without hardware
- Made assumptions based on extracted files
- Limited validation capabilities
- FEL mode complications (H713 BROM issues)

### This Rebuild (Hardware-First)
- ✅ **Root access to running device**
- ✅ **Full system dump capability**
- 🔄 **UART serial console access** (coming soon)
- ✅ **Live hardware validation** at every step
- ✅ **Proper baseline establishment** before modifications

## 🛡️ Hardware Safety Protocol

**CRITICAL: Two devices available for A/B testing**
- ✅ **Device A:** Primary development and testing
- ✅ **Device B:** Control device with factory firmware
- ✅ **Complete factory backup image** exists
- ✅ **NO BRICKING TOLERANCE** - all changes must be reversible
- ⚠️ **UART recovery required** before any risky operations

## Hardware Access Status

### Available Now ✅
- ✅ Root shell access via ADB/SSH
- ✅ Full filesystem access (including /system)
- ✅ Live kernel module inspection
- ✅ Direct hardware register access
- ✅ Real-time system monitoring
- ✅ Factory firmware preservation
- ✅ **Two devices for A/B testing**
- ✅ **Complete backup image**
- ✅ **UART serial console** (115200 baud, boot logs captured)
- ✅ **Boot process visible** (BOOT0 → ATF → OP-TEE → U-Boot → Linux)
- ✅ **U-Boot version identified** (2018.05-00027-ge159793)

### Phase II In Progress 🎯
- 🔄 U-Boot console access testing (autoboot interrupt)
- 🔄 Memory map extraction (from boot logs)
- 🔄 Boot chain comprehensive analysis
- 🔄 Recovery procedures validation

- **Hardware Damage:** Careful voltage/current verification

### Software Risks
- **Driver Incompatibility:** Maintain factory kernel as fallback
- **Configuration Loss:** Preserve all calibration data
- **Boot Failure:** UART-based recovery procedures

## Development Environment

Using Nix flakes for reproducible development:

```bash
# Enter development environment
cd /home/luca/Desktop/sun50iw12p1-research
nix develop

# All cross-compilation tools available
aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc --version
```

## Task Management

### Using task-manager Tool

```bash
# Check current status
ai/tools/task-manager list

# Start a task
ai/tools/task-manager start <task_id>

# Complete a task
ai/tools/task-manager complete <task_id>

# Get next recommended task
ai/tools/task-manager next
```

### Task Lifecycle
1. **pending** - Defined, ready to start
2. **in_progress** - Currently being worked (one at a time)
3. **completed** - Finished with validation
4. **blocked** - Cannot proceed (document blocker)

## Agent Guidelines

### General Agent Responsibilities
1. **Check for in-progress work:** Always run `ai/tools/task-manager find-inprogress` first
2. **Follow task priorities:** Use `ai/tools/task-manager next` for recommendations
3. **Update task status:** Mark tasks in-progress and completed properly
4. **Document findings:** Update relevant documentation as work progresses
5. **Validate at every step:** Use hardware access to verify assumptions

### Specialized Agents
- **hardware-access-agent:** Root access operations, system dumps
- **uart-agent:** Serial console operations, bootloader interaction
- **driver-analysis-agent:** Kernel module reverse engineering
- **device-tree-agent:** DTB creation and validation
- **integration-agent:** System assembly and testing

### Delegation Protocol
- **Atomic tasks only:** One clear objective per delegation
- **Complete context:** Include all necessary information in prompt
- **Hardware safety:** Always include safety protocols
- **Validation requirements:** Define success criteria clearly

## Quick Start - Phase I

```

### Step 2: Begin System Documentation
```bash
# Start first task
ai/tools/task-manager start 001
```

### Step 3: Create Complete Backup
See `hardware-access/hardware-dump-procedures.md` for detailed procedures.
